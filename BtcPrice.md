## The Long Term Price Requirement of BTC

Suppose for the moment that the bitcoin network will continue to be funded by the diminishing subsidy of BTC coins. Then, the question is, to cover the increasing costs of maintaining the network, how high would the BTC price needs to go? If we assume that the network costs continue to increase about 11% per year or roughly 50% per reward era, and the miners revenues are about the same as the costs, then it is easy to see that BTC price needs to triple every four years (2 x 1.5), as shown in the following table.

Year | Reward Era | Network Costs (Mil) | BTC Mid Price | BTC Market Cap (Mil) 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2023 | 4 | $10,434 | $31,800 | $667,800 
2027 | 5 | $15,651 |   $95,400 | $2,003,400 
2031 | 6 | $23,477 | $286,200 |  $6,010,200 
2035 | 7 | $35,216 | $858,600 |  $18,030,600

**Note: the values from 2027 to 2035 were generated with linear extrapolation, and they are by no means should be viewed as predictions.** The table shows the requirements, in terms of BTC prices and market caps, for the bitcoin network to continue to run on block subsidies. 

By 2035, the BTC price is required to exceed $850,000 in order to generate enough revenue for the network operators to cover their expenses. The total BTC market cap would exceed $18 trillion, which is almost half of the total capitalization of the S&P 500 stocks ($40 trillion in 2023). Of course, this will not happen. It is a fallacy to think that linear extrapolation actually works. The higher the BTC price goes, the slower its growth rate would become. 

In the second scenario, the transaction fees need to accelerate at much higher rate than today. Currently in reward period 4, each block generates 6.25 BTC, and the average fees generated from the transactions in a single block is less than 1 BTC, or less than 15% of the total income. In the next reward period when each block subsidy is halved to 3.125 BTC, the transaction fees are estimated to have to grow five fold if the block validators are expected to receive the same amount of total income. Therefore, charging sky-high fees is not a feasible solution in the long run. Before we explore the third scenario, we need to take a deep dive into the values of the bitcoin blockchain. 


## Block Subsidy Is Not Reward
Why isnâ€™t the block subsidy called a reward to begin with? Most people failed to understand the 'subsidy' part when they first heard about the reward scheme. After all, a predetermined amount of BTC is rewarded to the block validator who has solved the math puzzle of the chain and mined the next block. But if you consider the whole ecosystem of bitcoin network and all the beneficiaries involved, you will realize that it is not as simple as a reward to the validators. First, we need to identify all the beneficiaries who enjoy the benefits of having a robust, permissionless, non-stop bitcoin network. Are the users who are sending transactions in a given period of time the beneficiaries of the network? Certainly. But how about those hodlers who never trade in years? Yes, they are also the beneficiaries.

Imagine what will happen if there is a sudden cosmic storm that interrupts electricity all over the world. Are you able to sell a bitcoin if you absolutely have to? The answer is no, because the bitcoin network is down and nobody will be able to trade with you. This is different from gold. If you have a gold coin, you can trade it in some remote village with people for food and shelter, and no electricity is needed. This example shows that all the bitcoin hodlers are beneficiaries of the bitcoin network regardless if they have any transactions for any given period of time. However, the network can only charge users who actually send transactions in a given block, and those transaction fees are never meant to cover all the costs of running the network. That's why the network has been subsidized by minting the bitcoins. Therefore, the minted BTC is not a reward, but a necessary business subsidy for running the decentralized network. 

By now you have probably already known what is the next question to ask: what happens when the block subsidy goes to zero? Is the bitcoin network less valuable in the future when the subsidy disappears? Probably not. Then where are the missing values of the BTC blockchain after the subsidy pool has dried up?
